This blocklist is an optional supplementary filter list that completely removes all forms of tracking from the internet, including web bugs, tracking scripts and information collectors. Generated from [multiple input sources](https://github.com/fabston/little-snitch-blocklist/blob/main/SOURCES.md), collated, sorted for duplicates and merged into one single [rule group subscriptions](https://help.obdev.at/littlesnitch4/lsc-rule-group-subscriptions) file. The filter is only compatible with [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) for Mac. As a result of using it you will experience quicker loading and cleaner looking web pages with fewer distractions; lower resource waste (bandwidth, CPU, memory, battery etc.); increased privacy by blocking online trackers.

### 🐞 Domain additions, removals, false positives 

If you find something in a list that you believe is a mistake or breaks functionality, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/fabston/little-snitch-blocklist/discussions/categories/false-positive) and I'll consider removing it. Also, if you find an unblocked subdomain of a blocked root domain, please let me know so I can add it to a list.
